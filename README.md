# Behavioral Systems Repository

Behavioral and productivity engines designed to improve focus, adherence, and execution consistency in high-demand environments.

---

## Purpose
These applications enhance human performance by structuring time, attention, and task execution through measurable feedback systems. Each tool converts invisible behavioral patterns into visible metrics that can be optimized.

---

## Core Capabilities
- Focus state tracking
- Schedule adherence monitoring
- Behavioral reinforcement loops
- Productivity gamification
- Real-time performance feedback

---

## Included Systems
- Focus Timers
- Adherence Tracking Dashboards
- Execution Monitoring Tools
- Performance Reinforcement Engines

---

## Architecture Principles
- Client-side processing only
- Instant response interfaces
- No external infrastructure required
- Deterministic logic first, AI optional

---

## Tech Stack
Vanilla JavaScript • Canvas API • Notification API • Tailwind CSS

---

## Design Philosophy
These tools are built on behavioral engineering principles:  
visibility → awareness → adjustment → improvement.

---

## Summary
This repository demonstrates applied behavioral systems design for operational environments where focus, timing, and execution consistency directly impact performance.
